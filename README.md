# This is a C project I made in college that gets a csv file containing airline information and searches through its information.
First it gets the flight route records in the data.csv file (this can be any csv file containing flight records for any course of time, as long as the information is in the correct format).
Then it iterates through each line and puts all the information into a linked list.
It then prompts the user with a menu numbered 1-5 with different options on what to search the file for.
The user can follow the prompts and the script will print out the corresponding information.
The program ends once the user exits out of the menu loop.
